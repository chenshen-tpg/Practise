Question: "How would you design a system to allow multiple users to collaborate on a document in real-time (like Canva's editor)?"

Conceptual Approach:

Real-time Communication: Use WebSockets for persistent, bidirectional communication between clients and the server.

Consistency Model:

Operational Transformation (OT): A common approach where client edits are transformed into operations, sent to the server,

and then transformed again to be applied to other clients' documents,

ensuring eventual consistency.

Requires careful handling of concurrent operations.

Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs): An alternative that allows concurrent modifications on replicas

without requiring a centralized coordination server for conflict resolution. Operations are commutative and associative.

Backend Architecture:

Collaboration Service: A dedicated microservice handling WebSocket connections, operation transformation/CRDT logic, and broadcasting changes.

Document Storage: Persistent storage for the document's state (e.g., a database like MongoDB for flexible schema, or a relational DB for structured data).

Versioning/History: Store document versions or a log of operations to enable undo/redo and conflict resolution.

Client-Side:

Maintain a local copy of the document.

Send operations (e.g., insert character, delete range) to the server.

Apply incoming operations from other users.

Scalability: Horizontal scaling of collaboration services. Sharding documents across multiple servers. Load balancing WebSocket connections.

Trade-offs: Complexity of OT vs. CRDTs, latency vs. consistency, server-side vs. client-side processing.
