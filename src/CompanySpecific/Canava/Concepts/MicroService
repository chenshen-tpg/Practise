What are microservices? How do they differ from monolithic architecture?
=======================================
Answer: Define microservices as an architectural style where an application is built as a collection of small, independent, loosely coupled services, each focused on a specific business capability. Contrast with monolith: a single, tightly coupled, large application. Discuss differences in deployment, scaling, technology stack, team organization, and fault isolation.

What are the key benefits of using microservices?
=======================================
Answer: Independent deployability, improved scalability (horizontal scaling of individual services), fault isolation, technology diversity (polyglot persistence/programming), faster development cycles, easier maintenance, better alignment with business domains.

What are the challenges of adopting microservices?
=======================================
Answer: Increased operational complexity (deployment, monitoring, debugging), distributed data management/consistency, inter-service communication overhead, security concerns, testing complexity, network latency, need for strong DevOps culture.

How do microservices communicate with each other?
=======================================
Answer:

Synchronous: HTTP/REST (JSON/XML), gRPC. Best for requests requiring an immediate response.
Asynchronous: Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ), event buses. Good for decoupling, robustness, and handling high throughput.

Explain the concept of "service discovery" in microservices. Why is it important?
=======================================
Answer: The process by which microservices locate and communicate with each other dynamically. Important because service instances change their network locations frequently (due to scaling, failures, deployments). Discuss client-side (Eureka, Consul) and server-side (Load Balancer, API Gateway) discovery patterns.

Design Patterns & Concepts
What is an API Gateway? What are its responsibilities?
=======================================
Answer: A single entry point for all client requests. Responsibilities include request routing, composition, protocol translation, authentication/authorization, rate limiting, caching, and logging.

Explain the Circuit Breaker pattern. Why is it important in a microservices ecosystem?

Answer: Prevents a network or service failure from cascading to other services. When a service experiences repeated failures, the circuit "opens," stopping further calls to it and returning a fallback response or error immediately. After a timeout, it transitions to a half-open state to test if the service has recovered. Important for system resilience.

What is the Saga pattern, and when would you use it?
=======================================
Answer: A way to manage distributed transactions that span multiple microservices, ensuring data consistency. It involves a sequence of local transactions, where each transaction publishes an event that triggers the next local transaction. If a step fails, compensating transactions are executed to undo previous successful steps. Used when atomicity (ACID) across services is required but a traditional two-phase commit is not feasible.

How do you handle data consistency in microservices? (e.g., eventual consistency vs. strong consistency)
=======================================
Answer: Explain that strong consistency across all services is hard and often undesirable. Eventual consistency is more common, where data becomes consistent over time. Discuss patterns like the Saga pattern, event sourcing, or using idempotent operations.

What is Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and how is it related to microservices?
=======================================
Answer: DDD is an approach to software development that focuses on modeling software to match a domain model. In microservices, it helps define the "bounded contexts" for each service, ensuring that each service encapsulates a specific business capability and its associated data, reducing coupling and improving clarity.

Explain the concept of "Bounded Context" in DDD/Microservices.
=======================================
Answer: A Bounded Context is a linguistic and conceptual boundary within which a specific domain model is defined and applicable. It helps in identifying natural boundaries for microservices, ensuring that each service has a clear, well-defined scope and its own ubiquitous language.

What is a "Service Mesh" and what problems does it solve?
=======================================
Answer: A dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication. It provides capabilities like traffic management (routing, load balancing), security (mTLS), observability (metrics, tracing, logging), and reliability (retries, timeouts, circuit breakers) without requiring changes to the application code. Examples: Istio, Linkerd.

What is the "Database Per Service" pattern, and what are its implications?
=======================================
Answer: Each microservice manages its own private database. This promotes autonomy, loose coupling, and allows services to choose the best database technology for their needs (polyglot persistence). Implications include challenges in data consistency across services and complex data joins.

Implementation & Operations
How do you approach decomposing a monolithic application into microservices?
=======================================
Answer: Discuss strategies like the Strangler Fig pattern, anti-corruption layers, identifying business capabilities/bounded contexts, and gradually extracting services.

How do you ensure security in a microservices architecture?
=======================================
Answer: Centralized authentication (OAuth2, OpenID Connect with an Identity Provider), API Gateway for security enforcement, token-based authorization (JWT), mutual TLS (mTLS) for inter-service communication, secrets management (Vault), input validation, auditing.

How do you handle logging and monitoring in a distributed microservices environment?
=======================================
Answer: Centralized logging (ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana; Splunk), distributed tracing (Zipkin, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry), metrics collection (Prometheus, Grafana), health checks, alerting.

What is containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) and their role in microservices?
=======================================
Answer:

Docker: Packages applications and their dependencies into portable containers, ensuring consistent environments from development to production.
Kubernetes: Automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It handles service discovery, load balancing, self-healing, and rolling updates, making it ideal for microservices deployments.

How do you manage configurations in a microservices setup?
=======================================
Answer: Centralized configuration servers (Spring Cloud Config, Consul, etcd), externalizing configurations, environment variables, Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets.

What are idempotent operations, and why are they important in microservices?
=======================================
Answer: An operation is idempotent if executing it multiple times produces the same result as executing it once. Important for handling retries in distributed systems (e.g., payment processing, inventory updates) to avoid duplicate effects.

Describe your experience with CI/CD pipelines for microservices.
=======================================
Answer: Discuss automated builds, testing (unit, integration, contract, end-to-end), container image creation, artifact storage, automated deployments (blue-green, canary), and rollback strategies. Emphasize independent deployment pipelines for each service.

Advanced / Behavioral Questions
When would you not use microservices?
=======================================
Answer: Small, simple applications; applications with high transaction coupling; early-stage startups needing to iterate quickly; teams lacking strong DevOps experience or distributed systems knowledge.

Discuss a time you faced a challenge with microservices and how you resolved it.
=======================================

Answer: Be prepared with a specific example focusing on communication, data consistency,
debugging, or deployment complexity. Highlight your problem-solving skills and lessons learned.

How do you ensure backward compatibility when evolving APIs in microservices?
=======================================
Answer: API versioning (URI versioning, header versioning, content negotiation),
deprecation policies, robust testing, consumer-driven contracts.

Explain the difference between orchestration and choreography in microservices.
=======================================
Answer:

Orchestration: A central component (orchestrator) explicitly controls and coordinates the workflow of various services. (e.g., a workflow engine).

Choreography: Services react to events published by other services, without a central coordinator, relying on implicit communication and agreement. (e.g., event-driven architecture with Kafka).

How do you test microservices effectively?
=======================================
Answer: Unit tests, integration tests (testing interaction between two services), contract testing (using tools like Spring Cloud Contract or Pact to ensure service API contracts are met), end-to-end testing (testing the entire system flow), consumer-driven contracts. Discuss mocking external dependencies.
