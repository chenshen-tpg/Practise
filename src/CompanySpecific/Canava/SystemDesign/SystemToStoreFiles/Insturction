Conceptual Approach:

Core Storage: Use an object storage service like Amazon S3. It's highly scalable, durable, and cost-effective for static assets.

Content Delivery Network (CDN): Integrate with a CDN (e.g., Amazon CloudFront) to cache images at edge locations globally, reducing latency for users worldwide and offloading traffic from the origin.

Metadata Storage: A relational database (e.g., Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., DynamoDB) could store image metadata (user ID, file name, size, resolution, tags, S3 URL, access permissions).

Upload Process:

Users upload to an API Gateway/Load Balancer.

Backend service generates a pre-signed S3 URL for direct upload from the client, bypassing the backend for large files.

Upon successful upload, a notification (e.g., S3 event to SQS/Lambda) triggers metadata storage and potentially image processing (resizing, watermarking) using a separate microservice.

Retrieval Process:

User requests image via URL.

CDN serves cached image if available.

If not cached, CDN fetches from S3.

For authenticated/private images, the backend generates a temporary, signed URL for access.

Scalability & Reliability: S3 is inherently scalable and highly available. CDN provides global distribution. Database replication and sharding for metadata. Asynchronous processing for image transformations.

Trade-offs: Cost vs. performance (e.g., higher CDN usage for faster delivery), consistency models (eventual consistency for S3 vs. strong consistency for metadata).
