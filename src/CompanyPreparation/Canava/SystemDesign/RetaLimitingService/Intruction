Question: "How would you design a rate-limiting service for an API?"  Â 

Conceptual Approach:

Purpose: Prevent abuse, ensure fair usage, protect backend services from overload.

Algorithms:

Token Bucket: Each user/IP gets a bucket of tokens. Requests consume tokens. Tokens are refilled at a fixed rate. If the bucket is empty, the request is denied.

Leaky Bucket: Requests are added to a queue (bucket). They are processed at a fixed rate. If the queue is full, new requests are dropped.

Fixed Window Counter: Count requests within a fixed time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute). Simple but can have burst issues at window boundaries.

Sliding Window Log/Counter: More accurate, tracks individual request timestamps or uses a combination of fixed windows to smooth out bursts.

Components:

API Gateway/Edge Layer: Ideal place to implement rate limiting as it's the first point of contact.

Distributed Cache (e.g., Redis): Store counters/timestamps for each user/IP. Redis is fast and supports atomic operations needed for rate limiting.

Rate Limiting Service: A dedicated microservice that interacts with Redis to enforce limits.

Considerations:

Granularity: Per user, per IP, per API endpoint, per tenant.

Distributed Environment: Ensure consistency across multiple instances of the rate limiter. Redis's atomic operations are key here.

Handling Exceeding Limits: Return HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests), include Retry-After header.

Monitoring & Alerting: Track rate limit breaches.
