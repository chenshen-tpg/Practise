    a. Google Maps
    Shortest Path Algorithms : Google Maps uses variations of Dijkstra's algorithm and A* search, which are rooted in DP principles,
     to compute the shortest routes between locations.

    b. Amazon
    Recommendation Systems : Sequence alignment algorithms (based on DP) are used to match user preferences with product recommendations.
    Inventory Optimization : DP helps Amazon determine optimal stock levels across warehouses.

    c. Uber/Lyft
    Ride Matching : DP is used to optimize ride assignments, minimizing wait times and travel distances for both drivers and passengers.

    d. Bioinformatics
    Genome Sequencing : Tools like BLAST and FASTA use DP to align genetic sequences and identify similarities.

    e. Web Development
    API Rate Limiting : Memoization (a DP technique) is used to cache responses and reduce redundant API calls.
    Text Processing : Edit distance algorithms are used in spell checkers, autocomplete features, and plagiarism detection tools.
